        <h2>A Brief History of Railroads</h2>
        <p>The concept of rail transport dates back to ancient civilizations. Early forms of railways, known as wagonways, were used in Germany around 1550, utilizing wooden rails for horse-drawn carts. The evolution continued with the introduction of iron rails in the 18th century, leading to the development of steam-powered locomotives.</p>

This innovation paved the way for the rapid expansion of rail networks across Europe and North America, playing a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution.</p>
